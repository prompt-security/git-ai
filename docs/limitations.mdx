## Capabilities

| Category | Feature | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Agent Mode** | Attribute LOC added with Write \| Edit \| MultiEdit tools (default) | ✅ |
| **Tab Completion** | Attribute LOC from tab completions | ✅ (beta support) |
| **Editing** | Human edits of AI LOC move attribution to that developer | ✅ |
| **Editing** | AI edits of human LOC move attribution to the AI | ✅ |
| **Editing** | Adding code before or after AI Hunks does not break attribution (line shifting works) | ✅ |
| **Editing** | Undo / Redo operations correctly preserve attribution | ✅ |
| **Editing** | Copy / Pasting AI LOC within the same file keeps them attributed to AI | ✅ |
| **Editing** | Copy / Pasting AI LOC across files keeps them attributed to AI | ✅ |
| **Editing** | Code Formatting tools do not break attribution | ✅ |

## Supported Git Workflows

### Local

| Git Operation | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Merging branches correctly merges attribution | ✅ |
| Merging branches with `--squash` correctly merges attribution | ✅ |
| `reset --hard` resets attribution to the base commit | ✅ |
| git replace maintains correct attribution | ✅ |
| git worktrees maintains correct attribution | ✅ |
| Amending commits correctly preserves attribution | ✅ |
| After resolving git conflicts, attribution is correct | ✅ |
| Rebase correctly merges attribution | ✅ |
| reset `--soft` and `--mixed` maintains correct attribution | ✅ |
| Cherrypick correctly merges attribution | ✅ |
| `mv` (move or rename files) moves AI attribution to the new file | ❌ |
| Stash / Pop maintain correct attribution | ✅ |

### Server-Side

Because Authorship Logs are linked to commit hashes, server-side operations that create new commits will not have logs attached. You'll have to manually run `git-ai squash-authorship` after the squash or merge operation to update the attribution. 

We'll be publishing CI scripts and Apps to assist with this soon.
